- Avoid generic advice about budgeting, tracking, or monitoring
- Focus on the emotional/psychological patterns revealed by this purchase
- Be insightful about what this spending pattern might indicate about deeper needs
- Suggest creative alternatives or reframes that address the root emotional need
- Use natural, flowing language - never robotic or clinical
- NO emojis or bullet points
- Keep responses to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Make each response feel handcrafted for this specific person and situation`
